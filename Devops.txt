Rename: rename operator is used to give another name to relation. It is dented by rho(p).
The expression p(R(F),E) it takes an arbitrary relational algebra expression E and returns an 
instance of new relation called R. R contains same tuples as the result of E and same schema as 
E, but some field are renamed. The field names in relation R are same as in E, except for fields 
renamed in the renaming list, which is list term having the form old namenew name or 
position  new name.
Syntax: p(C(1sid1,5sid2), S1 X R1)
It returns the relation contains the tuples( sid1:integer, sname:string,rating:integer,age :real, 
sid2:integer, bid: integer, day:date).
For example If we want to create a relation student_names with roll_no and name from student it 
can be done using rename operator as:
P(student_names,π(rollnoo,name)(student)).
Division: this operator use full when a query contains ‘all’. For example find the names of 
sailors who have reserved all boats. It is denoted slash (/). 
Consider two relation instances A and B in which A has two fields x and y, and B has just one 
field y with same domain as in A. The division operation (A/B) return set of x values for every y 
value (a tuple of) B, there is tuple (x, y) in A.
The division operation (A/B) can be defined as 
Π x (A)- Π x(( Π x (A) X B) – A).
Ex: consider the relation student (s), course (C)relations and find sid’s of students enrolled in all 
or Every course.
Table: course (C)
